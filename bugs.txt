Bugs:
    Existing:
        Running test.sh sometimes fails as it attepts to run the examples.sql parallel to the server startup.
            This is because a connection cannot be established to the database before the database is started
            This can be avoided very easily by waiting until after the database is started before running tests on it.  
    Fixed:
        ClockReplacement was not iterating properly
            We changed the clock buffer to a LinkedHashMap
        New buffers were not being allocated properly on pin()
            We reordered the decement of numAvailable
